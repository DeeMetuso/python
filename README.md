#Python in job market
Python is a popular programming language that offers great job opportunities. Learning Python opens doors to various roles in the tech industry. 
To get a job, you may also need to learn other languages. This course covers the basics of Python and helps you get ready for the job market.
Python jobs can be in fields like working with databases, network programming, or becoming a software engineer or data analyst. 
Companies are switching to open-source software like Python, making it even more valuable. 
This course teaches you a lot in a short time and introduces you to a new way of writing code. So, if you're interested in tech careers, Python is a great place to start.

#History 
Python is a programming language created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum in the Netherlands. It's designed to be simple and reliable, and it comes with a handy library for many tasks that programs need to do. 
Python focuses on making it easy for programmers to write, read, and document their code. While some languages prioritize fast compilation, Python strikes a balance between speed and readability, making it easier for developers. 
Python is implemented in C, which means it can work on various operating systems like UNIX, Linux, Windows, and more. It was influenced by other languages like ABC and Modula-3.

#Comments in python
Comments are used in Python just as other programming languages. 
The purpose is the same; to add to the code useful descriptions on what is occurring for general documentation. 
They start with the # character and extend to the end of a line. For example: # this is a comment 
name = 'Metuso' #actually my surname

In the following declaration the # doesn't denote a character since it is within quotes
text = 'This character # is used to denote a comment'

Using python
The first exercise:
o = `This is how backslash character is displayed \n in python \n "\\"`
print(o)
The second exercise (write the word "python" using the * character): 
# the code is one print statement 
print("\n**** *   * ********* *   *  ****  *    *\n*  *  * *      *     *   * *    * * *  *\n****   *       *     ***** *    * *  * *\n*      *       *     *   * *    * *   **\n*      *       *     *   *  ****  *    *")
